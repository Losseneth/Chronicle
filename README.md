I installed fullPage for Angular, but I couldnt use it because it asked for a licence I couldn't get. Pretty sure I deleted it, but you could try installing it if it turns out I didn't.

## Notes

The api is in the Api folder, as the name suggests. The Chronicle folder is a fullPage.js version of the home page, because the Angular version of the library required a licence so I couldn't implement it in that version, so refer to that one to see how the page would function if I had been able to acquire a licence.
